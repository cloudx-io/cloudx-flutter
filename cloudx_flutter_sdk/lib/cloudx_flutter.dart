// This file exists solely for Flutter plugin compatibility.
//
// Flutter's plugin system expects a Dart file matching the plugin name (cloudx_flutter.dart).
// We use cloudx.dart as the main SDK entrypoint for clarity and modern naming,
// but this file re-exports cloudx.dart so that plugin registration and generated code work correctly.
// You should import 'cloudx.dart' directly in your own code.

export 'cloudx.dart';
